# We recommend against adding the Pods directory to your .gitignore. However
# you should judge for yourself, the pros and cons are mentioned at:

## Environment normalization:

# for a library or gem, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
# intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
# Gemfile.lock
# .ruby-version
# .ruby-gemset

# for intellij products
.idea

# rubocop
rubocop.html

# unless supporting rvm < 1.11.0 or doing something fancy, ignore this:
.rvmrc
